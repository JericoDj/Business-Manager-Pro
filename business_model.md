# My Business Manager — Business Model (App Review Responses)

---

## 1. Who are the users that will use the paid content, subscriptions, and services in the app?

The paid subscribers are **business owners and company administrators** (B2B users). They register a business entity within the app and manage their employees, clients, and company documents. The subscription is purchased by the business admin on behalf of their organization — not by individual end-users or consumers.

Employees invited by the admin use the app under the company's existing subscription at no additional personal cost.

## 2. Where can users purchase the content, subscriptions, and services that can be accessed in the app?

Subscriptions are purchased **outside the app via the Polar.sh web-based checkout** (a third-party payment processor). When a business admin chooses to upgrade, the app opens an external browser to the Polar.sh checkout page. Payment is collected entirely on the web — no in-app purchase mechanism is used.

This follows the **Reader App / Multiplatform Service** model: the subscription is a business SaaS service managed and sold on the web, and the app is one of several platforms where the purchased service is consumed.

## 3. What specific types of previously purchased content, subscriptions, and services can a user access in the app?

Users access the following based on their subscription tier:

| Plan | Price/mo | Admins | Employees | Features |
|------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 | 5 | Basic document & employee management |
| **Plus** | $29.99 | 5 | 15 | Expanded team size |
| **Pro** | $79.99 | 10 | 30 | Larger organization support |
| **Enterprise** | $199.99 | 20 | 100 | Full-scale business management |

All plans provide access to the same core features (document management, employee management, client management, AI-generated reports). Higher tiers unlock **higher user/admin capacity** — there is no gated content or premium-only features beyond team size limits.

## 4. What paid content, subscriptions, or features are unlocked within your app that do not use in-app purchase?

The paid subscriptions (Plus, Pro, Enterprise) unlock **increased team capacity** (more admin seats and employee slots). These are purchased via Polar.sh's external web checkout — not through Apple's In-App Purchase.

No digital content, virtual goods, or consumables are sold. The subscription is a **B2B SaaS service** for business/organization management, which qualifies as a multiplatform business service under App Store Review Guideline 3.1.3(a) — businesses that manage their operations across web and mobile.

---

## 5. Are the enterprise services in your app sold to single users, consumers, or for family use?

No. Enterprise services are sold exclusively to **businesses and organizations** (B2B). The subscription is purchased by a company administrator and shared across the organization's team. It is not sold to individual consumers or for personal/family use.

The app serves as a **business management tool** — companies use it to manage employees, clients, and documents. Individual employees access the app under their company's subscription and do not purchase anything themselves.
